\section{Subsequences and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem}

\bx{ % 2.5.1
    Give an example of each of the following, or argue that such a request is impossible. \ea{
        \item A sequence that has a subsequence that is bounded but contains no subsequence that converges.
        \item A sequence that does not contain 0 or 1 as a term but contains subsequences converging to each of these values.
        \item A sequence that contains subsequences converging to every point in the infinite set $\{1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, \dots\}$.
        \item A sequence that contains subsequences converging to every point in the infinite set $\{1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, \dots\}$, and no subsequences converging to points outside of this set.

        \item Impossible, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem tells us a convergent subsequence of the subsequence exists, and that sub-sub-sequence is also a subsequence of the original sequence.
        \item $(1 +1/n) \rightarrow 1$ and $(1/n) \rightarrow 0$. By interweaving the terms, we get $(1/2, 3/2, 1/3, 4/3, \dots)$ that contains subsequences that converge to both 0 and 1.
        \item Consider the sequence where there is an infinite number of terms for each element in the set \[
        (1, 1/2, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, \dots)\]
        \item Impossible, the sequence must converge to zero which is not in the set.
        
        Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbituary, pick $N>0$ large enough such that $1/n < \epsilon /2$ for $n > N$. We can find a subsequence $(b_m) \rightarrow 1/n$ meaning $|b_m - 1/n| < \epsilon/2$ for some $m$. By triangle inequality, we get \[
        |b_m - 0| \leq |b_n - 1/n| + |1/n - 0| < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon
        \]therefore we have found a number $b_m$ in the sequence $a_m$ with $|b_m| < \epsilon$. Repeating this process for any $\epsilon$ allows us to construct a subsequence that converges to zero.
