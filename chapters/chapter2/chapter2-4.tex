        x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{a-x_n}\] converges.
        \item Now that we know $\lim x_n$ exists, explain why $\lim x_{n+1}$ must also exist and equal the same value.
        \item Take the limit of each side of the recursive equation in part (a) to explicitly compute $\lim x_n$.

        \item Calculating the first few terms, we get $(3, 1, 1/3, \dots)$. I conjecture that \seq{x}{n} is decreasing. 
        \medskip

        Suppose $x_{n+1} < x_n$, then \[
        4 - x_n > 4 - x_{n+1} \implies \frac{1}{4-x_n} < \frac{1}{4-x_{n+1}} \implies x_{n+2} < x_{n+1}
        \]Thus, \seq{x}{n} is decreasing. Since $x_n < 4$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $4 - x_n > 0$ and hence $x_{n+1} > 0$. Since \seq{x}{n} is decreasing and bounded below, \seq{x}{n} converges.

        \item By definition of limits, changing the index of the sequence does not change its limit.
        \item Since $x = \lim x_n = \lim x_{n+1}$, \[
        x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{4 - x_n} \implies x = \frac{1}{4-x} \implies x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \implies x = 2 \pm \sqrt3 
        \] Since $x_n < 3$, then $x < 3$, hence $x \neq 2 +\sqrt3$ and $x = 2 - \sqrt3$.
